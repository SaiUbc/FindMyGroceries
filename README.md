## <center> FindMyGroceries </center> <br> <center> (A shopping list and grocery store recommendation system)

The aim of this project is to design an application that implements a system to store a user's shopping list and recommend the ideal grocery stores that the user should go to buy the shopping items. The system also recommends the user for the ideal grocery stores they should go and hence save money.

The application is mainly designed for, but not limited to:
- **Customers who live in a close proximity to a lot of grocery stores with price differences on daily supplies.**
- **College/University students who are looking to save time and money on frequent grocery shopping**
- **Senior Citizens**

This project particularly appealed to me because I have seen my friends at university who often take loads of time to figure out which items to get from what grocery store. Hence, I wanted to design something convenient and useful that would allow them and many others to make informed decisions as a consumer and also help them budget on their monthly expenditure when it comes to grocery shopping.
